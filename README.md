## Introduction

The notebook aims to provide insights into the financial health and future prospects of a company using historical data. It includes steps for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), building predictive models, and performing scenario analysis to understand the impact of different inflation rates on the company's financial metrics.

## Data

The analysis uses a CSV file named `Financial Statements.csv` which contains historical financial data of various companies. The dataset includes columns such as Market Cap, Revenue, Gross Profit, Net Income, Earning Per Share, and more.

## Installation

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/future-financial-analysis.git
    cd future-financial-analysis
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
    Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn pycaret
    ```

3. **Open the notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook "Future Financial analysis of the company.ipynb"
    ```

## Usage

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
    - Load the financial data from the CSV file.
    - Handle missing values and standardize the format of categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualize the distribution of numerical variables.
    - Analyze the market capitalization and revenue distribution by company and category.
    - Compute and visualize the correlation matrix of numerical features.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
    - Build a linear regression model to predict Net Income based on Revenue.
    - Use PyCaret to set up a regression experiment for predicting Gross Profit.

4. **Scenario Analysis**:
    - Perform scenario analysis to predict Net Income and Gross Profit under different inflation rate scenarios (Base Case, Optimistic, Pessimistic).

## Visualizations

The notebook includes various plots and visualizations to aid the analysis, such as:

- Histograms and box plots for numerical variables.
- Bar charts and pie charts for market cap and revenue distribution.
- Correlation matrix heatmap.
- Line plots for the evolution of financial metrics over time.

## Predictive Modeling

The predictive modeling section includes:

- Linear regression to estimate Net Income based on Revenue.
- PyCaret setup for regression analysis to predict Gross Profit.

## Scenario Analysis

The scenario analysis section explores the impact of different inflation rates on financial metrics, providing predictions for Net Income and Gross Profit under various scenarios.
